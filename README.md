Before I made this program, several of my friends expressed difficulty creating a good workout program that properly balanced rest days, muscle groups and a good variety of exercises.

This program aims to help those of us who are confused or overwhelmed by the task of creating (and following) a weightlifting schedule that properly balances the variables above.

The program takes two input (workout time = 60, 90 or 120 minutes) and workout goals ( "Get Bigger" or "Get Stronger") and generates a full weekly workout schedule with the following constraints:

Every muscle group gets worked at most twice per week and at least once per week.

All muscle groups must be worked out before any group repeats.

No muscle groups can be worked out on consecutive days.

Each daily workout must not exceed nums input.

If an exercise has been used, it can't be used again on the same day
